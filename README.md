Setting up the Environment
Once your repository is created, itâ€™s time to set up your development environment. There are two primary methods:

Using Dev Containers (Recommended for Windows)
Dev Containers offer an isolated environment using Docker, which prevents conflicts with your system and ensures all dependencies are managed within the container.

Steps:

Install Docker:
On Windows/macOS, install Docker Desktop.
On Linux, install Docker Engine.
Install VS Code and the Dev Containers extension.
Clone your repository:
For Docker Desktop: Start VS Code and clone your repo in a container volume.
For Docker Engine: Clone your repo locally, then open it in a container via VS Code.
Wait for the Dev Containers setup to complete.
